        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This paper proposes a novel reaction chain mechanism that helps microorganisms harness energy, separate from the traditional ATP pathway. It could fundamentally change how we understand biological energy processes.</p>

    <section id="Theory on heartbeat">
        <h2> The energy driving heartbeat: Not ATP within cardiomyocytes, but the concerted extracellular Fenton reaction energy orchestrated by all cells  </h2>
        <!-- <p>The theory suggests an alternative biological mechanism that allows microorganisms to convert energy in a manner that challenges the established ATP model...</p> -->
        <p> Which makes sense, that ATP in the heart cells can permanently power the  heartbeat, distributing oxygen and nutrients to the cells throughout the body, or that the cells throughout the body integrate their own extracellular Fenton reaction to permanently power the heartbeat?</p>
